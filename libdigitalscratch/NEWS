libdigitalscratch-1.1.0:
  * added MixVibes and Final Scratch vinyl support (speed/direction only)
  * added API functions to get default configurations values
  * source code license switched from GPL V2 to GPL V3

libdigitalscratch-1.0.0:
  * renamed project to Digital Scratch Library (libdigitalscratch)
  * refactored vinyl disc type
  * simplified volume management
  * removed build system based on autotools, switched to qmake
  * added few settings getter/setter in API
  * disabled position detection (not properly working for the moment)
  * built ubuntu 10.10/11.04 and Debian stable packages
  * removed completely internal capture management
  * cleanup source structure
  * support Serato Scratch Live CV02 vinyl disc

digital-scratch v.0.1.0:
  * implemented position detection
  * added API and scenario tests
  * improve dynamic buffer size algorithm (improve quality of speed detection)
  * added easy-to-use API functions for players
  * started implementation of external capture management

digital-scratch v.0.0.4 (not released):
  * add a new sample application to use digital-scratch under Win32
  * add Code::blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/) project files for Win32 (to
    compile dll) and Linux
  * modify configure script to compile a library
  * add a flag __LIBRARY__ to not compile Main.cpp when building a lib
  * add new contributor in file AUTHORS
  * change place of help(), get_version() and others
  * add a new file to use when compiling with a player : digital_scratch_api.h
  * main() function change to be compatible with new digital_scratch_api.h
  * add a configuration file (~/.digital_scratch) with sections (multiple
    turntables)
  * separate libdigital-scratch and digital-scratch-alsaplayer (now as an
    implementation with a player example)
  * do some changes in configure.ac and Makefile.am : now digital-scratch is just
    a library.
  * correct usage of change volume callback
  * add more analyzis parameters in config file
  * add an API function to get all available capture buffer size
  * add an API function to print all trace level used by digital-scratch
  * try to add a build-in direct_sound support, not functionnal for the moment

digital-scratch v.0.0.3:
  * better speed detection on slow speeds
  * callback management between sound_driver (capture data producer) and
    digital-scratch (consummer)
  * more easy to understand configure script outpout
  * add --enable-debug option in configure script
  * better management of Ctrl-C to quit application
  * better ALSA capture algorithm
  * configure script work under Win32 (--enable-win32 --enable-directsound
    --enable-directx_path="C:\DXSDK")
  * add -s (or --buffer_size) at the command line to specify size of
    buffer containing captured datas

digital-scratch v.0.0.2:
  * add configure script
  * modify speed detection algorithm
  * add direction detection algorithm
  * can control Alsaplayer
  * add RTAudio support (JACK, ALSA, OSS, CoreAudio, DirectSound, ASIO)
